#Variable rules
#1. Can't start variable name with a number unless you use an underscore
#at the very start e.g. _100HS 

#variable1 as an integer
variable1 = 500
print(variable1)

#variable2 as a string
variable2 = '150'
print(variable2)

#operational variables
variable3 = variable1**2
print(variable3)
